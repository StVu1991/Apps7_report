Steps I will do to make this solution production ready:

1. Create configuration file where all hardcoded values will be stored (for example DB connection parameters)
2. Split configuration file in one file for each environment
3. Implement log system - it is also useful in development, but it is especially useful in production when
lot of users will use the script and we want to know when something goes wrong with all details 
4. Implement Try&Catch blocks wherever it is possible - in order to prevent crashes
